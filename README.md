Topic: 
Healthy Trip Advisor: AI-Powered Urban Travel Safety System (SDG 3– Good Health & Well-Being)

//Problem Statement
Rapid urban development has led to declining air quality and increasing traffic congestion, exposing residents to significant health risks especially for vulnerable groups. 
Although real-time air pollution and traffic datasets are available, they remain separate, lacking integration into a unified system capable of effectively assessing environmental health conditions. 
These limitations reduce the efficiency of decision-making for both the public and city planners. 
Therefore, this website addresses the lack of a real-time, data-driven framework by developing an AI-based solution that combines air quality, traffic, and health data to generate a health suitability index and provide alerts when conditions become unsafe.
